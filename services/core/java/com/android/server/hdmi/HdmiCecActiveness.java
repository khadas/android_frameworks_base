/**
 * Notify the activeness of a playback
 * HDMI-CEC Activeness​integration is required in NRDP 5.2. Following doc provides the guideline
 * for Android TV Partner to integrate HDMI-CEC Activeness for Netflix.
 * Ninja uses "nrdp_video_platform_capabilities" settings to signal video output related events and
 * capabilities. The "nrdp_video_platform_capabilities" setting can be updated by invoking
 * Settings.Global.putString(getContentResolver(), "nrdp_video_platform_capabilities", jsonCaps)
 * jsonCaps is a JSON string, for example: {"activeCecState":"active", "xxx":"yyy"}
 * Ninja APK uses “activeCecState” key in “nrdp_video_platform_capabilities” json value for
 * HDMI-CEC Activeness integration. Android/Fire TV partners must report the correct
 * “activeCecState” value in “nrdp_video_platform_capabilities” json if it’s HDMI source devices
 * and device’s Ninja Validation Version >= ninja_7.
 * Following table describes the supported JSON Keys for “nrdp_video_platform_capabilities”:
 *
 * Accepted values:
 * ● "active": cecState dpi set to CEC_ACTIVE, dpi supportCecActiveVideo set to true
 * ● "inactive": cecState dpi set to CEC_INACTIVE, dpi supportCecActiveVideo set to true
 * ● "unknown": cecState set to CEC_NOT_APPLICABLE, dpi supportCecActiveVideo set to true
 * ● no activeCecState value in "nrdp_video_platform_capabilities" json string: cecState set to
 * CEC_NOT_APPLICABLE, dpi supportCecActiveVideo set to false
 * ● other value: has the same effect as no activeCecState value
 *
 * notes:
 * 1) If the device doesn't support HDMI-CEC integration or it’s non HDMI source source devices(e.g.
 * smart TV), activeCecState should not be set.
 * 2) If the device supports HDMI-CEC integration and it’s HDMI source devices(e.g. set-top-boxes a
 * sticks), activeCecState should be set to "active", "inactive" (or “unknown).
 * 3) HDMI-CEC integration is mandatory for ​HDMI source devices​with Ninja Version >= ninja_7
